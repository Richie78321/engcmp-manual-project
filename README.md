## Introduction


### What is FOSS?
Free and Open Source Software is Software that is released under the license and copyright by the owner; 
it allows people to modify, use, and distribute the author’s source code.

This is different from proprietary software as 
it is free and the source code can be edited by the user. 
Many times the users contribute to the software by fixing bugs, implementing new features, and 
testing the software for the owner.


### Git vs. Github
Git is a simple program to track the changes made in a project's code files. Github is a website that hosts repositories of code.


### ReadMe’s and Licenses
ReadMe and Licenses outline the rules of using software. Many ReadMes have an overview of the software,
a tutorial on how to install and run it and how to contribute to it if applicable. 

For larger projects, they will have a code of conduct as well. 
Licenses are the legal copyright of the code. 
They outline whether the code can be redistributed under a new license or sold.


### Why Should you Contribute?
There are many reasons to contribute to open source projects! Finding something you are 
interested in and contributing code can be beneficial. 
This is a great way to gain experience and technical skills.

Contributing to open source projects can also help you find or grow a community consisting of like-minded developers!
Contributors such as yourself are key in improving software development no matter how small your contributions are. 
You get to test new technologies, share and receive feedback, and communicate knowledge.


### What are you Interested in?
This may seem obvious but the first step in contributing to open source projects is to find something 
you are interested in. If this is your first time contributing, 
it is recommended that you find a small project that is easy to understand.

Smaller projects mean less code which also gives you more freedom on what you want to contribute. 
This can be a new feature for an app, a better website structure, or a small fix on a program.


### Finding an Issue
Finding a project that is small and tackable can be quite difficult for a first-time contributor. 
Finding an issue (without knowing whether there is one or not) can be even more daunting.

Fortunately, there are many great websites that do this for you and contain a collective list 
of various repo’s that have issues. [First timers only]("https://www.firsttimersonly.com/") is one such website that lists a culmination 
of other websites that contain numerous open source projects.
