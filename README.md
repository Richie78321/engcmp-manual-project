# Contributing to an Open Source Project

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you find an issue or project that you'd like to contribute to, it's time to learn how exactly you can go about contributing. The first step to contributing is exploring the source code.
#### Source Code Exploration
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're going to want to create a local copy of the project you'd like to contribute to on your machine.

Go to the GitHub page of the project and find the green button labeled "Code". 
Other repository sites will have a similar function.
